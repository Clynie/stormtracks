Example detection routine and data files.

There should be 8 files included with this README file. This should act as an example of how to use the cyclone detection routine and to check it's working.

1) The cyclone detection code (cyclone.f90) which needs to be compiled

2) The namelist file (nml.default) - This has been altered to have a windspeed threshold criteria of 11.5 m/s from 17.5 m/s  

3) The script to run it (detect_TCLV.csh). The directories and file names have been altered, as this version only loops through 2 months and the year 1999.

4) 2 files of monthly model data - example_199901.nc and example_199902.nc with the required variables included

5) 3 example output files which I obtained from running this version on the above netcdf files.  This is the output you should also be producing. tclv_out_199901.dat and tclv_out_199902.dat are the outputs for individual months. The .all file includes all the detections from this run.
